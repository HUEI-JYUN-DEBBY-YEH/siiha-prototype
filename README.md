# Emotion-Aware HR Assistant: A SIIHA-Inspired Conversational Prototype

This is a lightweight prototype of an emotion-aware HR assistant, built using conversational flows inspired by SIIHA — a previous HR-AI project. It explores how a Gemini-powered chatbot might detect emotionally charged language and offer human-centered, trust-rebuilding responses in real workplace conversations.

## How it works

The assistant is designed to:
- Detect key emotional states like shame, anxiety, or anger based on user input
- Suggest rephrasings grounded in HR best practices (PHRI-aligned)
- Provide cultural-contextual HR advice for typical workplace scenarios

The goal is to create a model of soft-power AI that supports HR professionals not only in solving tasks, but also in fostering workplace dignity and understanding.

## Why it matters

Most HR tools focus on compliance or automation. This prototype explores a different angle: emotional intelligence. In workplaces across Asia (and beyond), unspoken emotional cues often shape outcomes. This assistant aims to bridge that gap with responsible AI.

This project is part of a broader vision called "SIIHA" — Socially Intelligent, Interculturally Human-Aware Assistants — where AI is used to align with human values, not just outputs.
