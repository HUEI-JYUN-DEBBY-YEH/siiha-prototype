# Sample Conversation: Emotion-Aware HR Chatbot

**User:** I’m feeling really anxious. I messed up during onboarding and I think everyone’s judging me.

**Bot:** I'm hearing that you're experiencing some anxiety and self-doubt. That’s completely valid — new beginnings can be overwhelming.

Would you like to talk through what happened, or perhaps reframe how you might communicate this to your manager? Here's one suggestion:

> "I’m still adjusting to the onboarding process and learning the systems — I’d appreciate any feedback to help me improve."

This message keeps honesty and accountability, while inviting support rather than shame.

**User:** My coworker keeps ignoring my messages. I’m starting to get really angry.

**Bot:** It sounds like you're feeling dismissed, which can be frustrating.

Here’s a trust-building alternative you might consider:
> "Hey, I noticed it’s been hard to connect — let me know if there’s a better way to reach you or time to talk."

Approaching with curiosity rather than confrontation often leads to better outcomes in workplace dynamics.
